Last and Final Update:
            Added Stages:
                4 Main Stages:
                    Combat: Fight Normal Enemies
                    Shop: Buy Shopping Items:
                    Level UP: level up certain stats for your character
                    Boss: Encounter a boss
                    you will encounter a boss every 5 stages or so but everything else is completely random for when it shows up
            Added Leveling UP:
                you can now heal yourself after a stage
                you can also now level your max health, strength, and dex
                in the shop you can buy relics, these relics are registered right before the player cast cards
                speaking of buying items, killing enemies now gets you gold and the gold depend specifically on the enemy
                there is now more enemy variety with enemies having tendency to do some actions more than others and higher stat rolls for doing those actions
                    ex: a defensive enemy will want to defend more and when they defend will defend with a higher defense then others
                Added Bossses : these bosses have ALOT of health and do alot of damage but they reward you with alot of gold and Statpoints
                Infinite replayability:
                    The stages rotate for ever so there is essentially no win condition but you can lose and when you do all progress is lost
                    the higher you go the stronger the enemies get and the stronger the bosses
            Art Overhaul:
                added like 30-40 more assets 
                enemies, bosses, and players and now have hit animations after being hit or after casting a spell
                relics all have designs and the player was remodeled
            Recalulcation and rebalancing:
                now it is alot easier to attack cards then before and also there is weighted chance system for just about everything now
                it uses random and checks if the # is within a range to determine whether an attack will/will not happen or whether a stage will load or not
            Cut Bloat out some code that essentially did nothing was cut out
                I have no clue how much actually does nothing since this project is pretty sizeable at this point but i'm trying
            Made the battles 1v1 to compensate for the the low damage numbers and the realtively slow combat i wanted to make it seem more personal
            and more rewarding and less janky only with 1v1's
            Added Lots of enemies and bosses
                before there were only 2 enemies now there is 6 i think 
                and 3 bosses currently
        7 Relics i think
            play the game to find out what they do :)
